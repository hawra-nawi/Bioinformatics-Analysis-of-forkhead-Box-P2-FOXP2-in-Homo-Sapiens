# Bioinformatics-Analysis-of-forkhead-Box-P2-FOXP2-in-Homo-Sapiens

The bioinformatic analysis of the forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2) transcription variant 1 gene allows for a greater knowledge of the existing gene. This report discusses the problem of allocating the gene and protein, determining protein structure and function, and how the gene is expressed. A phylogenetic, sequence, proteomic and RNA analysis were used to derive various charts and plots in order to help determine and solve the problem
posed. Various database search tools and R programming language were used to computationally analyse the results and determine features of the gene and its protein.
